# confusion-coursera

This is a repository containing the React project I've worked on while taking the course Frontend Development with React 
hosted by Coursera.

It is a website for a restaurant. It is focusing more on implementation of the functionalities rather than the design .

It uses React, Redux, React animations, thunk, logger, React router and react bootstrap. 
Also it uses regular state management, not react hooks.

Json-server is used for storing the database.
